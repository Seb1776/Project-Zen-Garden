# Project Zen Garden (A Plants vs Zombies experience)

A VR Unity game based on the Plants vs Zombies universe, where you can have your own Zen gardens with over 200 different plants from across time and space.

## About

You remember the original Plants vs Zombies from 2009? Do you remember the little Zen Garden minigame? I personally enjoyed it a lot, trying to get all the plants and gathering money in the process. This game aims to recreate that same feeling with enhanced mechanics.

## Characteristics

- New and more plants!
- New Mechanics!
- 100% Free of Zombies

## Installation

Note that this project is being actively developed. This project is being made with Unity 2020.3.35f1 with the Universal Render Pipeline, note that using a different Unity version may need to re configure the URP in order to properly work

## Contributing
Pull requests are (as of right now) not welcomed, the game it's in an early stage of development
